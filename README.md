# PROHI Sepsis Prediction Dashboard

## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive dashboard for sepsis prediction and analysis in a clinical setting. The dashboard uses machine learning to predict sepsis risk and provides tools for understanding and interpreting these predictions.

## Features
The dashboard consists of five main components:

1. **Descriptive Analytics**: Explore and understand the dataset through visualizations and summaries.
2. **Diagnostic Analytics**: Analyze relationships between variables and identify factors correlated with sepsis.
3. **Predictive Analytics**: Generate sepsis risk predictions for individual patients using a pre-trained Random Forest model.
4. **Prescriptive Analytics**: Understand model predictions through SHAP values and get clinical recommendations.
5. **About**: Information about the project, dataset, team members, and references.

## Dataset
The project uses the [Prediction of Sepsis dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salikhussaini49/prediction-of-sepsis), which contains patient measurements from ICU settings.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/PROHI-Group-5/sepsis-prediction.git
   cd sepsis-prediction
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the `data` directory as `cleaned_dataset.csv`.

4. Run the dashboard:
   ```
   streamlit run Dashboard.py
   ```
